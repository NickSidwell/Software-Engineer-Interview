# DLR Group Technical Interview

The purpose of this exercise is to understand an applicants ability to *problem solve*, *think critically*, and *write software* with existing DLR Group Software Engineering team members. While there is no expected answer, we do expect the production of a working sample. That means the work must compile, transpile, or interpret and above all else run with no immediate exceptions.

You, as the interviewee, are encouraged to:

1. Ask Questions
1. Search the internet
1. Discuss your technical choices with interviewers

**NOTE: The desired outcome is a pull request to this repository that builds and can be run by interviewer with minimal effort.**

**We also do not expect to see build artifacts in your pull request.**
